# Go

Today is Sunday, November 13th. For certain reasons, I am on a time crunch to learn Go. 
I have a strong background in Python so this will be relatively intuitive. I am looking through a Go Cheatsheet to get an understanding of the syntax. 
After which I will work through some projects and put them up on this repo!

The projects and repo links will then be added to my website (timelems.fly.dev)
